# Introduction

Welcome to Cashful! This guide will help you quickly onboard merchants and start accepting payments. We recommend following the step-by-step tutorial that walks through account creation, organization setup, and initiating a checkout session.

# Quick Start

- Sign up and sign in to obtain a session token
- Create an organization and set it as active for the session
- Create customers and start checkout sessions or payment intents

For a guided walkthrough, see the tutorial: [Merchant Onboarding](../tutorials/merchant-onboarding)

# Authentication & Tokens

Authenticate using `POST /authentication/sign-in/email` to retrieve a session token. Include the token in the `Authorization: Bearer {sessionToken}` header for all protected endpoints.

# Recommended Next Steps

1. Follow the `Merchant Onboarding` tutorial to get your first integration running.
2. Implement webhooks to receive payment status updates and reconcile payments server-side.
3. Add idempotency keys where needed to prevent duplicate requests.
