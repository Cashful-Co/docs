description: How to sign in and obtain a session token for API requests.

# Introduction

All API requests (except sign-up and sign-in) require a session token or an API key.


# Session Token Auth

Sign in using `POST /authentication/sign-in/email` to retrieve a session token. Include the token in the `Authorization` header:

```
Authorization: Bearer {sessionToken}
```

Tokens may be returned in the response body or in the `set-auth-token` header. Store tokens securely and rotate them as needed.

# API Key Authentication

Another option is to use an API key using the `X-API-Key` header:

```
X-API-Key: {yourApiKey}
```

For more information on creating and managing API keys, see the API reference: [API Key Management](../../api-reference/endpoint/api/canary/authentication/api-key/create-api-key)
