# Introduction

This tutorial covers how to create, retrieve, and update customer records, which are needed for payment processing and storing payment methods.

# Create Customer

Use `POST /customers` to create a customer record. See the `Onboard a Merchant` tutorial for a concrete example.

# Retrieve & Update

Use existing `GET /customers/{customerId}` and `PATCH /customers/{customerId}` endpoints to retrieve and update customer information.

# Best Practices

- Attach metadata to customers for easier reconciliation (order IDs, source, etc.).
- Use webhooks to track updates to saved payment methods or customer changes.
