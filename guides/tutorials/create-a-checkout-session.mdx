# Introduction

This tutorial shows how to create a server-side checkout session and redirect customers to the hosted session to complete payment.

## Steps

1. Ensure you have a signed-in session token.
2. Create a `POST /checkout/sessions` request with `merchantId`, `customerId`, `lineItems`, and `currency`.
3. Read the `sessionUrl` from the response and redirect your customer to that URL.

See the `Onboard a Merchant` tutorial for a complete flow that includes checkout session creation.
